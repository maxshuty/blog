# blog

A blog using Strapi as a CMS. The CMS is built out and deployed, and the frontend built using Nuxt is a work in progress.

Strapi allows us to easily integrate and manage the content within the blog.

#Dependencies:
- `npm install pm2 -g` process manager for Node.js. It will come in handy to automatically restart the app if it crashes.
